        <div class="subheading mb-5">Probation Department Intern</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Daisy Peña, and I am currently studying Psychology at the University of California, Riverside. Recently, I began an internship with the Riverside Probation Department, where I actively assist probation officers and analyze the behaviors of individuals on probation. In this role, I am responsible for reviewing case files and creating comprehensive summaries that include each individual’s criminal history, details of any prior arrests, the specific circumstances surrounding their offenses, and the conditions assigned to them by the court. This meticulous process not only honed my analytical skills but also provided me with a deeper understanding of the complexities within the criminal justice system. In addition to my responsibilities at the probation department, I was given the incredible opportunity to work alongside a court officer, which allowed me to observe court proceedings firsthand. This experience has been eye-opening, as I have gained insight into the various styles of courts within our justice system, including the Hall of Justice, family court, and superior court. Witnessing trials has further enhanced my ability to assess how individuals react in high-pressure situations, particularly through their facial expressions and body language. These nonverbal cues often reveal much about a person's emotional state, intentions, and responses to the legal processes they are undergoing.<br><br>

        Although probation work is not my ultimate career goal, the experience I am gaining is invaluable, particularly regarding behavioral patterns associated with various criminal offenses, such as domestic violence, drug trafficking, and child endangerment. Observing recurring behaviors and thought processes across different cases is shaping my perspective on human behavior. As I look forward to a career in criminal psychology, my goal is to continue gaining hands-on experience and enhancing my skills in preparation for a Ph.D. program. I am committed to making a meaningful impact in the field of criminal justice, and I view this internship as a crucial stepping stone toward that goal.<br><br>

Prior to interning, I worked in several part-time jobs over the course of 3 1/2 years to gain valuable real-world experience before moving on to bigger opportunities. During this time, I held positions in fast-food restaurants and retail, both of which allowed me to develop essential skills, such as customer service, time management, and teamwork, while also providing a steady source of income. Since the age of 16, I’ve taken on financial responsibilities, which taught me the importance of budgeting, accountability, and hard work. Academically, I graduated high school with the prestigious Seal of Biliteracy in recognition of my fluency in Spanish, and I achieved honors with distinction while maintaining a 4.2 GPA. In college, I continue to uphold a high academic standard with a 3.25 GPA, and I’ve excelled in my psychology courses, achieving high grades and developing a strong understanding of the subject matter. Additionally, I’m actively involved in cultural organizations such as La Hermandad and the Chicano Student Program, where I participate in events that foster community and cultural awareness. I also work part-time on campus as a student dining service worker at The Barn, where I am committed to maintaining a clean and responsible work record, further developing my reliability and strong work ethic.
